# Exam-task1
Another exam task from EGE 2018 year
This time the we need to calculate how many pairs of numbers in string will give us product of numbers of 26.  For this, we will count amount of numbers that are multiple of 2,13,26 and just amount of numbers. If our current number is multiple of 26, then we can add all the previous numbers, if of 13, then only multiples of 2 and so on.
